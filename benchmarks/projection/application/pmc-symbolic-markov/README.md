_Note: some instances are unsatisfiable. The instances in the **bound** subfolder also appear in the **precision** subfolder._

These formulas are bounded model checking queries for symbolic discrete-time Markov chains.
The solution count divided by the total number of assignments to the projection variables corresponds to the probability to reach some group of states.
The problems are derived from the [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org) benchmark set.
