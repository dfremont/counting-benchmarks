# iscas89-xor
Provided by: Supratik Chakraborty, Kuldeep Meel, and Moshe Vardi.

These formulas consist of ISCAS'89 circuits with random XOR clauses on the gate outputs.
The instances count the number of inputs which cause the XOR clauses to be satisfied.
The input variables are given as an independent support.

The filenames are of the form "C_X_Y.cnf" where C is the name of the circuit, X is the number of XOR clauses, and Y is the number of literals in each XOR clause.
